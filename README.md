# Automated-Testing-System

Automated-Testing-System, the name itself suggests that it automates something. The something is the C program. This project is a server-client model where the user the user enters his/her name, sends the submission (C program) to the server for marking. Before that the test cases to test on the C code have to be entered on the server-side. The server then tests the submission with the predefined test cases. It generates a feedback report saves it on the local machine under the students' name and it also sends it back to the client. The client can see which test-cases his/her submission has passed/failed. All this takes place in a time span of 2-3 seconds.

It is completely built on Java (Java swing and socket programming).

Benefits: This system can be used by the instructors/professors; it will save them the time to mark the students' work and they can spend more time on teaching students and other course related work.
